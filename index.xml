      <description>This post is intended to be a summary of two excellent posts about mock from Uncle Bob. One post titled as &amp;ldquo;The Little Mocker&amp;rdquo; shows different types of mock. The other one shows in which situation we should use mock. Although in The Little Mocker, Uncle Bob has pointed out that &amp;ldquo;mock&amp;rdquo; is just colloquial slang for Test Double, we still use it here for its common use.</description>

But I am still a beginner at coding, and I still have a lot to learn. So this blog is meant to record my learning process and share the interesting knowledge and opinion I learned in this way.</description>

      <description>1. Install shadowsocks client sudo pip install shadowsocks
2. Fix bug in shadowsocks  You can skip this step first, and come back if sslocal does not work. Typically, this happens on the machines with ARM architecture.
 Replace string &amp;ldquo;libcrypto.EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;libcrypto.EVP_CIPHER_CTX_reset&amp;rdquo; in openssl.py, which is located somewhere like /usr/local/lib/python2.</description>
